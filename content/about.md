I believe humanity is a creative force. If you give people tools to create, it is guaranteed you will see something amazing on the horizon.

I obsess over climate tech and audio tech, with a healthy helping of user interface and useability. I have a long history of work in these areas.

My specialty is full stack product development, ideating, connecting customer needs, and business goals, creating design and engineering documents, executing MVPs, and delivering a finished consumable product. I love working in this cycle and if you do too, we should talk.
