I'm a software dev who is obsessed with music and system management. They're the only two things I tend to think about outside of software development.

I love to learn how the world, and structures inside of it are self-organized. I love to create and dissect art and music. And I like to build products that empower people to do new things.

Historically, I've worked in different SaaS and startup companies in a variety of roles including R&D and manufacturing management. I spend a lot of time with finance and product folks and like to sit at the intersection between how a product is made, and why it is made.

I am somewhat tech-stack agnostic, am familiar with OOP, procedural, and functional languages (Python, Go, Java, C++, C, Haskell, and Javascript flavors.) However, I prefer to work in languages that have the most mature end-to-end development libraries for particular tasks. For frontend I'm currently working in NextJS. I haven't settled on a backend yet, but have used Python, React, PHP, and R. For app development I am exploring Flutter, and for DSP (Audio Software) I work in JUCE C++.

I have an extremely deep level of business experience and a growing level of software experience. If you'd like to talk more, please reach out via linkedin.
