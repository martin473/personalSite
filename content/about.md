This site is developed in Go and is extremely low impact on the development side.

It is developed in Hextra, a Hugo template, which is a Go variant. 

Go is a performant web language that can create front and backend code with only one language. Hugo is a variant of go designed to deploy in cloud servers extremely fast. Hextra itself is pre-styled and edited by creating markdown files, updating folder structure, and editing a few lines on config files. It can be hosted for free in digital ocean, edited in github codespaces which is an online free ide. It also has github control built into the ide.

It looks decent, takes less than a minute to push changes, is extremely simple to update.

It is a bad choice for ecommerce, but extremely solid for text based personal sites such as this. While I can code in Go, I have done absolutely no Go dev for this site. Only markdown. The main downside is because it is prestyled, changing javascript and css behavior is hidden from the core functionality of the editor, and if you want to shift from Hextra, you will have to choose another template which may not use Github Actions and the Digital Ocean free static site distribution. Initial setup for this site, including all of the learning required in a completely new paradigm was less than half a day.
