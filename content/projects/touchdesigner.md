title: Touch Designer 3D Animation

{{< vimeo 996398920 >}}

There's quite a lot that goes into these videos.

Many are audio reactive which means they take incoming streaming audio data and react to different frequencies or instruments to adjust the animation.

Some use 3D modelling to animate and explore 3D space.

Some have video integrated into the design.

Others use calculus and point mapping to create complex 3D objects that can then be manipulated in novel ways.

Many utilize 3 dimensional math calculation and object instantiation that are translated into RGB values to further interact with Touch Designer objects.

Enjoy!
