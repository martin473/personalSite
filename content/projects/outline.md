Describe 3 key things you made

Images
    Include embeds for 3 TD and 3 P5js max



Audio DSP software
    Explain juce dev process on linux and windows
    Explain books and other things used to research techniques and further learnings
    Explain simple concept of distortion and interest
    Explain basic issues solved (clipping reduces volume unless you scale it up) you also need to correctly handle phase
    Project was a personal research project. Completed, next software planned: spice fet modelling or other forms of distortion exploration

Ableton file browser
    Images or video of it running
    Explain use cases
    explain multiple iterations of UI (pyqt6 qt creator) pros and cons
    deprecated because ableton live 12 has tagging and searching, I found a better way to use live to work through songs similar to my current project. Users would likeley feel the same
    Future projects of this nature will likely be built in flutter or javascript/JUCE due to cross platform compatibility, build cycle, available UI kits and DSP modules, and sdlc in those languages.
